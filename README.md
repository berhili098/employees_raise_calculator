# Isar 4.0.0 Test Repository

This repository serves as a testing ground for exploring and evaluating Isar database version 4.0.0. It is created solely for experimental purposes to understand the features and capabilities of this specific version.

Please note that this repository's structure and organization are not optimal and should not be used as a reference for best practices. The code and architecture here prioritize experimentation over proper software design patterns.

## Purpose

- Test Isar 4.0.0 functionality
- Explore new features and improvements
- Evaluate performance and usage patterns
- Experiment with different approaches (not necessarily following best practices)
- Document findings and limitations

This is not intended for production use and lacks proper:
- Error handling
- Code organization
- Testing coverage
- Documentation standards
- Security considerations

Use this repository only for learning and experimentation purposes.
